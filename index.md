Soon after obtaining my degree I started to work as a network engineer in order to concrete the attained knowledge. Despite of gaining broad experience in this field I decided to continue my furthur studies in Europe. I was awarded by the Erasmus Mundus scholarship sponsered by European Commission in PERCCOM program.
